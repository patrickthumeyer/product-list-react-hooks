This repo is features a React product List with Sorting functionality, filter by name, next and previous buttons on the product page, the 4 top products on the home page.
For navigation I used React Router and its params and for the styling Sass.

I did a similar exercise already but the idea was to get used to the more modern way and therefore I tried to build it with React Hooks.
