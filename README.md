# React Product List - State Hooks

This repo features a React product list with sorting functionality, filter by name, next and previous buttons on the product page, and the 4 top products on the home page.

For navigation I used React Router and its params and for the styling I used Sass including mixins and nested classes.

I previously did a similar exercise already but the idea was to get used to the more modern way and therefore I tried to build this products list with React Hooks.

Feel free to check it under by clicking on the link in the about section :)
